# Heuristic-Algorithm-Path-Planning-Simple

A python code to simulate a simple heuristic path planning algorithm which decides which step to take i.e. euclidian distance between the current position and the goal position. 
Current code has the functionality to take a step of step size 1 in either X or Y one at a time. You can add a diagonal step too to further optimize the path.
